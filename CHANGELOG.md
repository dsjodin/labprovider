### Features
- Add Authentik identity provider service module for VCF 9 identity federation with OIDC authentication and outbound SCIM 2.0 provisioning
- Seed an opinionated Authentik bootstrap blueprint with one group, one lab user, one OIDC provider, and one VCF application
- Set the Authentik brand web certificate to the discovered step-ca keypair after startup
- Add explicit DNS backend selection via `DNS_BACKEND` (`unbound` or `technitium`, default `unbound`): `--all` deploys only the selected backend, direct backend flags fail fast on a mismatch so the second DNS server cannot land on a converted host, and `--dns-sync` requires the technitium backend
- Make `config/unbound.records` optional for NetBox: when absent, the import is skipped with a notice instead of failing (the file remains required by the unbound backend, which renders it)
- Add `DNS_FORWARDER` as the shared upstream forwarder for both DNS backends (falls back to `UNBOUND_FORWARDER` when unset); the technitium backend now configures its upstream forwarder over the settings API on bootstrap and verifies external resolution before pointing the host at itself, so Technitium can act as the sole nameserver for the host and lab
- Be sure to update your `config/provider-box.env` (new `DNS_BACKEND` and `DNS_FORWARDER` variables).

### Fixes
- Fix `--authentik` failing intermittently on re-run at the brand step with "Failed to determine the default Authentik brand": Authentik rejects even valid API tokens for a few seconds after container start, and `/-/health/ready/` does not imply token-auth readiness. A new authenticated readiness gate polls `GET /api/v3/core/brands/` with the Bearer token (bounded, 401/403 retried within the window) before any brand or blueprint configuration runs, with a timeout message that distinguishes a persistent-data token mismatch from a transient startup delay. Per-attempt curl stderr is also suppressed in the HTTP readiness wait and the certificate verification poll, which previously printed normal "connection reset" and "self-signed certificate" retries as error noise
- Fix built-in Provider Box service FQDNs (netbox, ca, dns, auth, idp, ...) never reaching the Technitium zone: dns-sync now synthesizes their A records from `provider-box.env` on every reconcile, using the same built-in list as the unbound backend (`provider_box_builtin_fqdns`, which now also covers `AUTHENTIK_FQDN` and skips unset services); they are deliberately not seeded into NetBox because the pinned NetBox enforces global IP uniqueness (verified live: duplicate host-IP objects are rejected without anycast roles), and A-only synthesis keeps `PROVIDER_BOX_FQDN` as the sole PTR target; the post-deploy zone verification now checks every built-in FQDN resolves via Technitium
- Fix the long-running dns-sync container failing every reconcile with "connection refused": the `127.0.0.1` extra_hosts pins pointed at the container's own loopback on the default bridge network; the service now runs with `network_mode: host`, matching the module's one-shot docker runs
- Remove the Technitium forwarder step from `--dns-sync`, which silently overwrote the `DNS_FORWARDER` value the technitium module sets and verifies (one owner per setting); the unused `TECHNITIUM_FORWARDER` variable is removed from the example env
- Include the NetBox response body (about 200 characters) in dns-sync client errors on non-2xx responses so failures like 403 are diagnosable from logs
- Auto-provision the dns-sync NetBox token during `--netbox`, mirroring the technitium module's token handling: a stored token at `DNS_SYNC_SECRETS_DIR/netbox.token` is validated live and reused (operator-placed tokens win while valid); otherwise a dedicated token with description "provider-box dns-sync" is provisioned, previous tokens with that description are retired, the composite is validated with one authenticated request, and it is written with the same ownership/permission conventions; skipped with a notice when `DNS_SYNC_SECRETS_DIR` is unset so `--netbox` stays standalone
- Fix Technitium HTTPS never being enabled, which broke the `--dns-sync` HTTPS gate: `--technitium` now converts the step-ca certificate to PKCS#12 (with a generated, persisted bundle password), enables the web service TLS listener via the settings API (`webServiceEnableTls`/`webServiceTlsPort`/`webServiceTlsCertificatePath`/`webServiceTlsCertificatePassword`, verified against 13.4.2), and confirms `https://<DNS_FQDN>:<TECHNITIUM_HTTPS_PORT>` serves the step-ca chain before finishing
- Replace the "capture the API token from the console" manual step: `--technitium` now creates a non-expiring API token via `/api/user/createToken` and stores it at `DNS_SYNC_SECRETS_DIR/technitium.token` (0600, container uid) where `--dns-sync` expects it, reusing a stored token as long as Technitium still accepts it
- Fix `--dns-sync` failing at its reachability gates with "Could not resolve host" when the lab zone is not resolvable yet - which is always the case, since dns-sync itself populates the zone: the NetBox and Technitium gates now pin the lab FQDNs to `127.0.0.1` with `curl --resolve`, the one-shot dns-seed containers and the long-running dns-sync container get the same pinning via `--add-host`/`extra_hosts` (Go resolves through `/etc/hosts`, TLS verification stays full against the lab root), and a new post-sync check confirms over real DNS that the zone is actually served after the first reconcile
- Fix NetBox API authentication against NetBox 4.6 v2 tokens, which reject the legacy `Token` header with 403 "Invalid v1 token": the seeding helpers now build `Authorization: Bearer nbt_<key>.<token>` from both fields of the provision response (falling back to the legacy header when no `token` field exists), validate the header with an authenticated request immediately after provisioning, and dns-sync/dns-seed accept the stored composite `nbt_<key>.<token>` and send it as a Bearer credential
- Fix NetBox 4.6 API token provisioning failing with HTTP 500 "API_TOKEN_PEPPERS is not defined" by generating and injecting the required `API_TOKEN_PEPPER_1` (>= 50 chars); the pepper is persisted under `NETBOX_DIR/secrets` and reused on every redeploy so existing API tokens (including the dns-sync token) stay valid, and can be seeded explicitly with the optional `NETBOX_API_TOKEN_PEPPER` variable
- Fix certificate issuance failing when the lab DNS zone does not resolve yet (for example while bootstrapping the DNS service itself) by pinning `CA_FQDN` to `127.0.0.1` via `--add-host` in the step-ca certificate issuance containers across all six certificate-consuming service modules, making issuance DNS-independent per the single-node design where step-ca always runs on the same host
- Fix Docker Compose installation on Ubuntu, where apt resolves the transitional `docker-compose` package name to `docker-compose-v2` and the dpkg-based post-install check on the literal name failed; install `docker-compose-v2` explicitly (Ubuntu 22.04+) and verify compose by capability (`docker compose version`) instead of by package name
- Fix step-ca crash-looping on first start caused by root-owned `CA_DATA_DIR` and secrets directory that the container user (uid 1000) could not read; the ca module now owns the CA data directory recursively as 1000:1000 while keeping restrictive modes (secrets 0700, password file 0600), matching the ownership handling of the other step-ca-dependent modules
- Replace the misleading "step-ca configuration was not created" error with a bounded initialization wait that polls for `config/ca.json` and then for the CA health endpoint, failing with an actionable message pointing at the container logs
- Fix `--technitium` failing to bind port 53 on stock Ubuntu where the systemd-resolved stub listener holds `127.0.0.53:53`: the module now preflights port 53 before starting the container, disables the stub listener via a `resolved.conf.d` drop-in while repointing the `stub-resolv.conf` symlink so host resolution survives the transition, fails fast (without stopping anything automatically) when a different service holds the port, points `/etc/resolv.conf` at Technitium only after the DNS listener verifies, and restores the stock systemd-resolved configuration on `--technitium --remove`
